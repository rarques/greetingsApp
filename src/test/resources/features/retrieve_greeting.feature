Feature: Retrieve Greeting
    In order to be aware of current greetings
    As an API user
    I want to get the details of particular greetings

    Scenario: retrieve an existing greeting
      Given the greetings repository has the following greetings:
        | message      | email             | date       |
        | Hello World! | test1@example.org | 11/30/2014 |
        | Bye          | test2@example.org | 12/01/2014 |
      When the client requests greeting with id 2
      Then the response is a greeting with id 2 and content "Bye"

    Scenario: retrieve a non-existing greeting
      Given greeting with id 999 doesn't exist
      When the client requests greeting with id 999
      Then the response is status code 404
